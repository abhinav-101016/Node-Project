            <p>This is a simple yet powerful web application built using pure Node.js without any external frameworks.
                It serves multiple HTML pages using custom routing, and delivers static assets like images and stylesheets with clean and efficient handling. The project demonstrates how web servers work at a low level — managing requests, routing, and content delivery
                 — all from scratch. It's a great example of how much you can accomplish with just Node.js and core modules like http, fs, and path.
